            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly Offered, for the bringing in a <hi>BILL,</hi> to Encourage Privateers, and to Demonstrate, that such a <hi>Bill</hi> as is proposed, will not Evade the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition Act, or any thing, except as to Prize Goods.</head>
            <p>THE great Reason why Prize Goods were not allowed to be Excepted out of the Act for prohibiting Trade with <hi>France</hi> was, because by such an Exception, all <hi>French</hi> Goods would be imported by way of Merchandize under the Colour of Prize Goods, and so the design of the Act Eluded.</p>
            <p>For the preventing which Mischief, 'tis proposed, that upon all Goods taken, and brought in as Prize, such a Value may be set, as doth not exceed Nine parts in Ten of the prime Cost, which must have been paid for them in <hi>France,</hi> if they had been bought there.</p>
            <p>As for Instance, If <hi>Burdeaux</hi> Claret be wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 7 <hi>l.</hi> a Ton in <hi>France,</hi> then let every Ton, that is brought in by way of Prize, be valued at a Tenth part less than 7 <hi>l.</hi> which is 6 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> and let the Nine parts which belong to the Captors be delivered at that Price, to such Commissioners as shall be appointed by Their Majesties for that purpose and the Commissioners to sell it for the best advantage of Their Majesties.</p>
            <p>And so let proportionable Rates be set upon all other Prize Goods.</p>
            <p>By this means 'twill be next to an impossibility, that any Trade should be privately carried on with <hi>France,</hi> under the colour of Prize Goods, for no Merchant will buy Wines, or other Goods, in <hi>France,</hi> and be at the Expence of Shipping them there, and also at the further Charges of fitting out Privateers here, to go and take such Ships and Goods, when they are sure they shall lose a Tenth part of their first Cost in <hi>France,</hi> besides all their other Expences.</p>
            <p>And the better to prevent any fraudulent Importation of <hi>French</hi> Goods by way of Merchandize, under the Colour of Prize Goods, 'tis proposed First.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That a Clause be added to the Bill that every Captain, Master, or other Chief Officer of the Ship, which takes a <hi>French</hi> Prize, shall bring it into such Port, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is next to the place where such Prize was taken, and within 6 Hours after bringing the same into such next Port <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to declare to the Chief Magistrate of the Port that the Vessel and Goods brought in were taken as Prize.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the Captain, Master, and other Officers of the Ship, be compelled to swear, that such Vessels, and goods, so taken and brought in by them, were really, and <hi>bona fide</hi> taken as Prize.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If any Goods brought in, and sworn to be Prize, are not really so, but are fraudulently brought in by way of Merchandize; That in such Case the Person or Persons, detecting such Fraud, and Convicting the Master, or other Officers thereof, shall have the advantage which the Captors should have had.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That after such Prize be brought in, the Captain, Master, or any other Person, shall not presume to land any of the Goods, before the same be Condemned as Prize, nor after Condemnation, without Licence from the Commissioners.</p>
            <p n="5">V. If any Captain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not bring in their Prizes to the next Port, (unless drove to any other Port by stress of Weather) or refuse to swear, they were really, and <hi>bona fide</hi> taken as Prize, or if they Land any of their Goods otherwise than as aforesaid: In every such Case, the Goods to be deemed Imported contrary to the Prohibition Act, and the Goods, and the Captain, Master, Officers, Mariners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be subject to the Penalties in the said Act mentioned.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That a Clause be added to prevent the Farming, or taking any Grant or Lease of the Prize Goods or any part thereof, or the profits arising thereby. Together with such other Clauses as to the great Wisdom of this Honourable House shall seem Necessary.</p>
            <p>By such a Bill, among many other Advantages that will Arise to Their Majesties and the Kingdom, First</p>
            <p>An Addition will be made to Their Majesties Revenue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>French</hi> Trade will be much streightned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>French</hi> Prisoners taken by our Privateers, will be a means to redeem our <hi>English</hi> Seamen, and others, that are Captives in <hi>France.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="4">4. Besides the Addition which will be made to the Number of Seamen, by the Redeeming many Mariners from the <hi>French</hi> Slavery, there will be a constant Nursery of Seamen maintained by the Privateers, which will give security to be ready upon any Summons from Their Majesties, or the Lords of the Admiralty, to serve Their Majesties in Their Men of War.</p>
